This is where you put the contents of your *About* page. Like all your pages, it's in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format.

Thank you very much to **Jeremy Howard** and **Sylvain Gugger** for their wonderful book *"Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch. AI Applications Without a PhD"*. This blog is composed of ideas distilled from reading it.
